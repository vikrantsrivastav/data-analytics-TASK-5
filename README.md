# data-analytics-TASK-5
ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship â€“ Task 5, where the objective was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
The goal is to extract insights using statistical and visual exploration, and to summarize findings in a clear, structured way.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Files Used:

train.csv â€“ Main dataset for analysis

test.csv â€“ Test dataset (not used in EDA)

gender_submission.csv â€“ Reference submission file

ðŸ›  Tools Used

Excel (for descriptive statistics, pivot tables, charts, and correlation analysis)

CSV Files loaded directly into Excel

ðŸ“Š Analysis Performed

Data Exploration

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, min, max)

Frequency counts of categorical variables

Univariate Analysis

Histograms for Age, Fare

Boxplots to detect outliers

Bivariate Analysis

Gender vs Survival (PivotTable & charts)

Class vs Survival

Age vs Fare scatterplots

Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix for numeric variables

Conditional formatting to highlight strong relationships

Summary of Findings

Overall survival statistics

Gender and class differences in survival

Age and Fare patterns

Key takeaways

ðŸ“‘ Key Insights

Survival Rate: 38.4% overall

Gender Impact: 74% of females survived vs only 19% of males

Class Impact:

1st Class: 63% survived

2nd Class: 47% survived

3rd Class: 24% survived

Age: Survivors were generally younger, with the youngest passenger being 0.42 years and the oldest 80 years

Fare: Higher fare-paying passengers had better survival chances
